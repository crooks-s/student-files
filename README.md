## Introduction
Treehouse Unit 5 Project. This application retrieves 12 random users from the 'randomuser.me' API and displays a modal when a user card is clicked.

## Tech Stack
HTML/CSS. JavaScript.

## Process/Learning (to be updated)
1. Dom Manipulation
2. Array iteration methods
3. Enumerable iteration methods
4. Async..await and fetch methods
5. Promise object handling
6. DRYing and refactoring
7. Event listeners and event handlers
8. Modal creation and handling

## Improvement
Could add a search function.

Clone the project, and simply open ```index.html```
<br /> Otherwise, I have a live version [here](https://crooks-s.github.io/student-files/).
