Team Treehouse Unit 5 Project

This application presents a compilation of 12 random users retrieved through the 'randomuser.me' API. Upon clicking a user card, a modal is created and displayed with additional information about the selected user. The modals may be closed with using the 'escape' key on the physical keyboard, clicking out of the modal, or clicking the 'X' close button on the modal. 

This is a Team Treehouse project demonstrating:
1. Dom Manipulation
2. Array iteration methods
3. Enumerable iteration methods
4. Async..await and fetch methods
5. Promise object handling
6. DRYing and refactoring
7. Event listeners and event handlers
8. Modal creation and handling
